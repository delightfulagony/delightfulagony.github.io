Welcome to my personal site. Firsts things first: I do this entirely for fun.
Although I'd like to have a proper site to talk about interesting and/or fun
stuff, for the time being I don't really know where this is going.

Even worse, I'm not good with being public and publishing stuff, I like my
privacy and I've lost habit through years of not really being on social
media. Even if I don't plan to disclose any personal details or talk about
personal stuff here, my plan is to test the waters of the internet and see what
I feel like doing.

I have tons of ideas but who knows what the future holds, certainly not me.
